<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Greetings, I am Ayan Majumder. <br />
  I'm a second-year college student pursuing a computer science B.Tech.<br />
  I recently began studying full-stack development, and I started by studying HTML with Angela Yu on Udemy.<br />
  This will be the first project I deploy in my career.<br />
  I hope you will look forward to my upcoming project.<br />
  <h4>Have A Good Day ðŸ˜Š</h4>
